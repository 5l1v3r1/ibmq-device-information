# IBM Q backend information.

## Organization

The *ibmqx-backend-information* repo contains information useful to IBM Q users

### Backends
The *backends* directory contains information about the IBM Q backends. At the moment there are documents for available hardware backends. Soon, we will update this to include specifications on various simulation backends. We anticipate the simulation backends to be community-driven as well, and we welcome the inclusion of new ones that can plug into our interface.
