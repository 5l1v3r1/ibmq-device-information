# Backend information.

## Organization

The *ibmq-device-information* repo contains information useful to Qiskit users of the remote IBM Q backends.

### Backends
The *backends* directory contains information about the remote IBM Q backends. At the moment there are documents for available hardware backends. Soon, we will update this to include specifications on various remote simulation backends.
